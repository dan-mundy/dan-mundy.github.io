## Web Development Learning Exercises  
### Description:  
This is a list of various projects that I've worked on for learning Javascript, HTML, CSS, and BOOTSTRAP.  

### Installation:
There's no installer for these projects, these are set to run locally on via my GitHub page.  

### Usage:  
For "The ball exercise" - the user can put in an integer and press the button to generate the requested number of balls on the page.  
One ball bounces back and forth diagnally on the page.

### Roadmap:
I'd like to continue learning HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, and JAVASCRIPT. In the future, I'd like to develop a few random games but also a number of tools and api to make life simpler.
